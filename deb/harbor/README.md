# Harbor

Harbor is an OS X-style dock, redesigned for touch screens.

Compile with [theos](https://github.com/dhowett/theos). I've tried to make it as easy as possible. After installing theos *properly*, and setting your device IP and port, `make package install` should be all you need to run!

Precompiled copies will be available for purchase in the BigBoss repo once purchases are enabled, for those who wish to contribute / don't want to compile. If you do this, thank you very much!
