# Packix

The Cydia Repository Manager to make developer's lives easier.

After Packix is set up everything is done via web apps, uploading packages, changing descriptions, adding screenshots, all of it.

It also handles generating the pages for each package and will even support selling packages, it also will also allow users to rate and comment on packages. Packix only allows authentication with third parties as to prevent the headache of managing usernames and passwords itself. It uses PassportJS which means tons of different login providers can be added easily to give users more choices.
